## Description

This project was built for the purpose of providing a user to find breweries in a certain location or name and get the weather to help plan a trip to a brewery.
Our motivation for building this project was our willingness and wanting to learn more in depth about using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript, and how to really connect it all together from scratch to create a functional webapge that serves a real-world problem. This problem occurs when people decide to go to a brewery and have their trip turned upside down due to being uninformed and unprepared for the rainy and stormy weather. Throughout the project, we were able to truly polish and lock in the basics of coding with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We also were able to learn how to deal with issues pertaining creating branches, pulling and pushing code up into the repo, implementing apis and meshing the code together. Overall, this project has been a tremendous help in learning how to code but more imporantly, learn how to work as a team, delegate tasks, and overcome issues that come with coding.
